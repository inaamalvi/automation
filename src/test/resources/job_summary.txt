1. How the connection request program should work
It should read personal data with  lnkdn_connected = 0 and link_id <> '' and source = 'lnkdn_imp'
then check it profile on linkedin and if the status is pending then update  lnkdn_connected = 1 (requested) with request date =0 
if no connection request made then make a request on linkedin and update    lnkdn_connected = 1 (requested) with request date
if connection already made then  update lnkdn_connected = 2 (requested) with request date
and get data of the this profile like email address, phone number  and update personal data table


2. Another program to read connected listed and get data such as email and phone number and update
if option selected is "companies" then update companies table and employer table
else
only personal data
